# Angular Website: Tip Calculator 

## Description 
Quick showcase of Angular component-based app design with SCSS styling. The application was built based on a UI design provided by [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). In this web app, the user may input a bill amount ($), calculate the tip, and split the total + tip among a number of people. 

## Usage:
Since it is a simple application, I have hosted it on GitHub Pages [here](). I did so by getting the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript produced by Angular and Sass. 
### UI Design:
